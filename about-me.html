            Welcome to my personal website - my name is Junhong Liao and I'm currently a 3rd year undergraduate CS student at Columbia University.
        </p>
        <p>
            Previously, I was a summer analyst in TPG Capital's New York Real Estate Investment team, where I learned how to methodically evaluate prospective investments in the commercial real estate space across the US. I have also worked as a summer analyst within the Leveraged Finance divison of JPMorgan's Investment Bank, where I was introduced to the equity and debt capital markets and learned how to help the world's largest companies raise hundreds of millions in debt funding. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Most recently, I was a software engineer intern at Ultimate Software, a B2B HRTech Company. During my time there, I had the opportunity to lead the design and implementation of a software solution using Java, Maven, Spring, and Micrometer to track MongoDB query performance in our core application's microservices. Through this effort, I successfully optimized query efficiency with new indexes, resulting in an ~82% decrease in inefficient queries over a measurement period of three weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also received the opportunity to work on a new API endpoint for the next generation of our flagship application, introducing search, update, and delete functionality for customer data in the next iteration of my team's core application, projected to be used by over 40 internal engineering teams.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately, my goal is to pursue co-founding a software business that solves a meaningful problem in the world.
