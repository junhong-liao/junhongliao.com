            Hello, and welcome to my personal website! My name is  Jun, and I’m currently a third year undergraduate at Columbia where I study computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
            When my mom and I immigrated here to the states, we barely spoke English. Over time, my mom worked part time and was able to save enough to buy me a set of CDs with english lessons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every evening after my mom got back from work, we’d sit in the living room of our one bedroom apartment and go through English lessons together. The result wasn’t perfect English, but it was a foothold in this country, and I don’t think we’d be where we are today without the transformative impact that those little CDs had on our lives. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So at the age of four, I learned how big an impact technology (no matter how modest) can have on people’s lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I enrolled at university, I brought that passion for technology with me, and I chose to study computer science. During my time at Columbia, I’ve managed a mentorship program of over 50 students and helped double the size of our alumni community in the tech industry to over a thousand active members by way of leading a monthly newsletter to hundreds of readers.
        </p>
        <p>
            I didn’t start my career in technology—I did my first internship in Investment Banking at JPMorgan, and spent the following summer in Private Equity at a firm called TPG. I loved getting the chance to work with so many diverse clients across so many different industries, all with their own unique needs. I loved thinking about market strategies, and working across a wide range of internal teams to deliver results—but as someone who still had a passion for technology and wanted to build, I couldn't help but feel something was missing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This feeling that something was missing led me to a HRTech company called UKG, where I worked across the stack to deliver developer tools to 40+ engineering teams. I got the opportunity to work closely with product managers and my engineering manager, and got the chance to own and lead two of my own projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            As soon as my internship ended, I got to building. I recently published my first chrome extension to the web store, focused on bringing accessibility to the web reading experience for people with ADHD, as someone who’s battled ADHD my whole life.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I think back on these experiences and I try to connect the dots, I’ve realized several things I’d like my career to center around. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I’d like my work to be focused on cutting through the ambiguity and noise, and identifying the signals that really matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’d like my work to be focused on being a great leader, without having to rely on what my title says. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Above all else, I’d like my work to be centered around building products that solve meaningful problems for people—the same thing those little English CDs were able to accomplish for my mom and I.
