        When my mom and I immigrated to the US, our english was... broken.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
      At times, trying to get by on broken english felt like an uphill battle we were slowly losing together. But my mom worked tirelessly at the local mart, saving slices of her paycheck to buy me a set of educational CDs so I could have the opportunity to learn english, at just 5 years old.

        We didn't walk out of the experience with perfect English, but little by litte, the lessons became a foothold in this country for my mom and I. As humbling as it is to admit, I don't think we'd be where we are today without the transformative, lasting impact those CDs had on our lives.

      That belief stuck. It carried me to Columbia to study computer science. It shaped my decision to lead a 50+ person mentorship program and help double Columbia's tech alumni network. It lingered even during my time in investment banking and private equity - valuable experiences, but not ones that scratched my itch to create.

      I wanted to build - so I did. At UKG, I led developer tooling projects used by 40+ teams. Then I built a Chrome extension to make web reading easier for people with ADHD - something I've battled with my whole life. Now, I'm working on a project to help construction companies make faster, more efficient estimates. Through all of it, I've realized I care most about 3 things in my career:
